\section{Introduction \& Background}

Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a security domian in CPU who is isolated from the other. TEE is capable of providing confidentiality and intergity for the codes and data stored in it. 

TrustZone is the first commercial hardware architecture to support TEE. After development in these years, TrustZone is widely used in mobile devices to provide trusted computing. TrustZone seperates the hardware and software resources, such as memories, I/O, and interrupts, into two parts, Secure world and Non-secure world (i.e. Normal world). Correspondingly, processors have two state, Secure state and Non-secure state, to access resources in two different worlds. Running on TrustZone, TEE-kernel  There are many 

Virtualization is a technology to divide the hardware resouce and create virtual instances who act like a real system. Since 1960s, virtualization has been always popular in computer science. The trend of virtualization is more intense these year, especially after cloud computing becomes more and more popular. However, TrustZone is not designed to be virtualizable in the past few years. All virtual machines managed by the same hypervisor shoudld trust the same TEE, while there are amount of vulnerabilities discovered in major venders' TEE-kernel.
